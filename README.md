# odin-recipes
Recipe site in HTML, assingment from Odin Project.

In this project i will be doing a simple and crude HTML site with a small list of random recipes.

Each recipe will be contained in it's own relative page with the following:
- Title
- Image of the completed recipe
- Description
- Unordered list containing the ingredients
- Ordered list containing the steps to be followed

This will help me train my coding with the html language and file organization for the website.
